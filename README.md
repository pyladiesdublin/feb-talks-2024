# Talks
## ⭐️ BIG DATA DELETION USING APACHE ICEBERG AND AIRFLOW by AKSHITA AGGARWAL
Handling big data is challenging. The sheer volume of data, often in the terabytes or petabytes, makes storage, processing, and analysis difficult, requiring specialised tools and techniques. In this talk, we discover how we handle Data deletion on these big datasets at Pinterest and dive deeper into Apache Iceberg's innovative approach that transforms the landscape of big data management. From using Apache Airflow dynamic DAG mechanisms to adding customisation and robust testing, we walk through the data deletion landscape.

## ⭐️ WHAT TIME IS IT RIGHT NOW() by ANTONIA BAUMANN
What date & time is right now() depends on when you ask and where, as in which timezone you are located in. Python’s `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` function sounds like it has all of that information to provide you with a reliable datetime.
This talk explores the attractive nuisance that is `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` and what “aware” and “naive” time is in python.

## ⭐️ GUERRILLA PYTHON: I’LL AUTOMATE MY JOB, EVEN WHEN ENGINEERS DON’T HELP by LUCA LODI
Jane just learned how to code and analyze data in python, her life is going to change for the better
She is looking forward to apply all those skills to the day to day tasks at work ... BUT!
IT does not allow to install python on the company laptop, requesting engineers to make the data available takes months,
data still need to be copied manually from some old web UI to an excel sheet for analysis ... frustration
This talk will cover concrete examples and tips to:

Run python from your browser, without wasting tears on setting it up (pyodide)
Scraping data from some web pages into Excel (CSS selectors and pandas)
Other automation/analysis ideas with python, straight from the browser

## ⭐️ WHERE CYBERSECURITY MEETS PYTHON by ANNA BARON GARCIA
Cybersecurity Engineering is a computer science discipline that had traditionally favored programming languages such as C and Assembly and scripting languages such as Bash and JS. So where does Python fit into cybersecurity?
This session introduces the benefits of python in cybersecurity and how you can use python to solve cyber challenges.
